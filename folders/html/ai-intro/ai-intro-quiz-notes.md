## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  We do not believe that AI will replace coders, but we believe that coders who use Ai will replace those who dont.
- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  Ai will be most useful for writing small functions that are likely to have been written many times
- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  I do not know enough to know if the answer is good or not.

AI Responses:

1. Will AI replace software developers?
   AI will augment rather than fully replace software developers. While AI-powered tools can automate repetitive coding tasks, generate code snippets, and even optimize existing solutions, they lack the ability to fully understand context, creativity, and complex problem-solving the way humans do. Software development isn’t just about writing code—it involves critical thinking, architecture design, collaboration, debugging, and innovation, all of which require human intuition and expertise. AI will likely transform the role of software engineers, shifting their focus from writing basic code to higher-level problem-solving, system design, and AI-assisted development. Those who adapt and learn how to leverage AI effectively will thrive in the evolving landscape. 2. What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
   AI tools should be used as an assistant, not a crutch. The best approach is to use AI to enhance understanding rather than shortcut the learning process. Here’s how to use it effectively:
   • Code Explanation: Ask AI to explain concepts, code snippets, or algorithms in simpler terms.
   • Debugging Assistance: Use AI to analyze errors and suggest potential fixes, but try to understand the cause before blindly applying a solution.
   • Code Optimization: After writing code yourself, use AI to suggest improvements, helping you learn best practices.
   • Project Inspiration: Use AI for brainstorming project ideas or structuring complex implementations, but ensure you fully grasp the logic behind the suggestions.
   • Pair Programming: Treat AI like a mentor or coding buddy that can provide guidance and help you debug, rather than simply generating entire solutions for you.
   The key is balance—use AI to support your learning but still actively engage in the problem-solving process. 3. What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I’m still learning?
   The biggest danger is developing dependency without comprehension. If you rely too much on AI-generated code without fully understanding it, you risk:
   • Superficial Learning: Copying AI-generated solutions without grasping the underlying logic or concepts.
   • False Confidence: Feeling like you know how to code because AI is providing solutions, but struggling when AI isn’t available.
   • Security & Ethical Risks: AI tools sometimes generate inefficient, insecure, or biased code, which can lead to serious vulnerabilities if not reviewed carefully.
   • Debugging Deficiency: If you don’t develop strong debugging skills early on, you’ll struggle to troubleshoot issues in real-world applications where AI may not always provide accurate or sufficient guidance.
   • Weaker Problem-Solving Skills: Learning software development is about developing an analytical mindset. If AI is always solving problems for you, you may not develop the necessary problem-solving intuition.
   The solution is to use AI as a learning aid, not a shortcut—always review, analyze, and rewrite AI-generated code in your own words to reinforce understanding.
